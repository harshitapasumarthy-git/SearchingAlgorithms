# SearchingAlgo
This repository contains a React.js application that demonstrates and compares the time complexity of various search algorithms. The goal is to provide an educational tool for understanding how different search algorithms perform in terms of time complexity.

# Introduction
Search algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. This project aims to compare the time complexity of different search algorithms using a visual and interactive React.js application. Users can input arrays and search elements to see how each algorithm performs.

# Features
* Visualization of search algorithms
* Time complexity analysis
* Interactive user interface
* Comparison of different search algorithms

# Technologies Used
* React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* JavaScript: Programming language
* Plotly.js: JavaScript library for data visualization
# Results
The results of the time complexity comparison are displayed visually using charts. Users can see how the number of operations increases with the size of the input array for each algorithm. This provides a clear understanding of the efficiency of each search method.
